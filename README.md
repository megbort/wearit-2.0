# WearIt v2.0

Welcome to WearIt—an urban clothing retailer concept built with Next.js.

This is the second iteration of the project, initially created during my early days of learning front-end development. In this version, we’re incorporating modern techniques and enhancements based on the original site’s concepts. Expect many ongoing updates and improvements 😊.

Hope you enjoy exploring!
